Assignment A:
=============
It continues to allocate new memory without ever freeing it up (because it calls malloc without calling free afterwards). This leads to indefinite growth in memory consumption until the program is killed or the host runs out of RAM/swap and crashes.

Assignment B:
=============

Assignment C:
=============

Assignment D:
=============
Busy wait delay takes more CPU time, but less real (wall clock) time. The difference is because instead of sleeping for 5 seconds, the threads just "spin" while doing "useless" work. Therefore it actually uses 5 seconds of CPU time.

Results of execution:

Version using sleep(5):
----------------
real    0m5.002s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.000s

Version using busy_wait_delay(5):
----------------
real    0m3.135s
user    0m5.000s
sys     0m1.264s
